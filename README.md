# ChristmasProjectgr11
You are an amazon employee. Due to the inhumane work conditions and low pay, you decide to unionize; unfortunately, Jeff Bezos knows all. He traps you in his room of sadness, a giant cardboard box filled with all sorts of Christmas gifts for the season being flown in a giant delivery drone. You must escape, for the sake of your freedom, and fair labor practices.

you start by waking up in what appears to be a giant cardboard box full of presents; 3 giant wrapped presents that act as different rooms. In each room, there are different objects, some useful, some useless, and you need certain ones to escape. Once you're done there is also another room that is unlocked once you clear the other rooms.

Kind of like an escape room.
